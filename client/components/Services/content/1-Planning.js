      <p>
        You wouldn't go on holiday without booking accommodation; an Architect wouldn't build a house without consulting with a surveyor and the council. Why is it then that too many companies let their contractors loose to dig up the streets  without proper planning and design and then blame them when things go wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
        Pulse Networks works with it's clients to provide detailed planning and design so that there are no surprises. All aspects of construction are documented so that the contractor knows what to do and what is expected.
